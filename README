==Making a Connection

The following code is a sample database configuration object.

  ActiveRecord::Base.configurations = {
    'arunit' => {
      :adapter  => 'advantage',
      :database => 'c:\test\arunit.add',        #equivalent to the "Data Source" parameter
      :username => 'adssys',                    #equivalent to the "UserID" parameter
      :password => ''                           #equivalent to the "Password" parameter
  }

==Creating a new project.  The following is based on the tutorial at http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

1. Create the application:
        rails new blog

2. Switch into the new application folder
        cd blog

3. Create three databases.  This can be done via ARC using SQL
        CREATE DATABASE "c:\blog\dbprod\blog_production.add";
        CREATE DATABASE "c:\blog\dbtest\blog_test.add";
        CREATE DATABASE "c:\blog\dbdev\blog_dev.add";

4. Edit the file GemFile and add the activerecord-advantage-adapter
   gem 'activerecord-advantage-adapter'

5. Edit the config/database.yml file to match the following

development:
  adapter: advantage
  database: c:/blog/dbdev/blog_dev.add
  username: adssys
  password:

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  adapter: advantage
  database: c:/blog/dbtest/blog_test.add
  username: adssys
  password:

production:
  adapter: advantage
  database: c:/blog/dbprod/blog_production.add
  username: adssys
  password:
